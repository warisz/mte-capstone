We had a long discussion after spotting the pitfalls in our initial design and problem-solving approach. Here are the summary below.

Design Feasibility:
- Most parts should be custom designed and manufactures, which is too much work for the given resource.
- With only around 4 months left, we concluded that finishing the original robot design isn't realistic.

Main concern:
- The robot design is too complex for a small, niche problem
- It's unclear which industry our product serves within the pipeline market, and existing methods like water jetting already work well.

New idea:
- Create an external pipe monitoring system instead of a cleaning robot.
- Use eddy currents to detect corrosion under insulation (CUI).
- This approach is simpler mechanically while focusing more on electrical/software challenge.

Market note:
- [Eddyfi](https://www.eddyfi.com/) currently leads this space but their technology looks outdated and is very high cost, which makes the room for improvement.
