## Project Description

**Need Statement:**  
Industrial and building systems require a practical, affordable, and reliable way to detect corrosion under insulation in steel piping, since current inspection methods are costly and designed mainly for large installations.

**Problem Statement:**  
Design a low-cost, modular, and non-destructive testing device that can be rolled along insulated pipes and provide a real-time imaging of corrosion under insulation (CUI), while adapting to various pipe sizes and geometries.
